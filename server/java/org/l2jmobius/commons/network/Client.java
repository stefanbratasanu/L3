/**
 * Abstract client entity that owns a {@link Connection} and manages packet I/O.<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Fair-send mechanism:</b> a single global {@link ConcurrentLinkedQueue} ({@code PENDING_CLIENTS}) is used across all active clients. Whenever a client wants to send it atomically acquires the {@code _writing} flag, then adds itself to the pending queue.<br>
 * The client polled from the front of the queue sends its next packet. This round-robin approach ensures no single client can monopolise the I/O threads when many clients are active simultaneously.<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Packet dropping:</b> when {@link ConnectionConfig#dropPackets} is enabled, packets that return {@code true} from {@link WritablePacket#canBeDropped} are silently discarded once the estimated outbound queue exceeds {@link ConnectionConfig#dropPacketThreshold}.
 * @param <T> the concrete {@link Connection} subtype bound to this client
