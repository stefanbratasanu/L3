 * All asynchronous I/O is dispatched from here; completion logic lives in {@link ReadHandler} and {@link WriteHandler}.<br>
 * <br>
 * Thread-safety: the {@code _client} reference is declared {@code volatile} because it is read by NIO completion-handler threads.<br>
 * An {@link AtomicBoolean} guards {@link #close()} against double-close races that can occur when a read failure and a write failure fire concurrently.
 * @param <T> the client type associated with this connection
