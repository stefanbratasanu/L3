/**
 * Holds aggro-related information for a single aggressor against an NPC.
 * <p>
 * This holder tracks two independent counters:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Hate</b>: used for target selection / threat calculations.</li>
 * <li><b>Damage</b>: used for contribution tracking and auxiliary logic.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Values are capped to avoid uncontrolled growth. This class is intentionally lightweight and mutable. Concurrency control, if needed, should be handled by the owner container (e.g. the aggro map in {@code Attackable}).
